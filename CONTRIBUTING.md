# Contributing to Unleash-Edge

## Getting started

Before you begin:

- Have you read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)?
- Check out the [existing issues](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash-edge/issues)
- Browse the [developer-guide](./developer-guide.md) for tips on environment setup, running the tests, and running Unleash-Edge from source.

### Don't see your issue? Open one

If you spot something new, [open an issue](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash-edge/issues/new). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix. If we need more information in order to look into issue we'll respond on the issue and also and mark the issue as `more-information-needed`. Please note that we have an active bot monitoring our open issues that will close issues marked as `more-information-needed` if we haven't received a response within 14 days. If this happens, please don't hesitate to reopen the issue with more information.

### Ready to make a change? Fork the repo

Fork using GitHub Desktop:

- [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
- Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

Fork using the command line:

- [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

Fork with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces):

- [Fork, edit, and preview](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace) using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) without having to install and run the project locally.

### Build and run the project

Follow the steps in [the "how to run the project" section](#how-to-run-the-project) to get the project running locally.

### Make your update:

Make your changes to the file(s) you'd like to update. You'll need **Rust 1.66.1** run unleash-edge locally. [See more details](developer-guide.md)

### Open a pull request

When you're done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review by opening a pull request.

### Submit your PR & get it reviewed

- Once you submit your PR, others from the Unleash community will review it with you. The first thing you're going to want to do is a self review.
- After that, we may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.
- Did you have an issue, like a merge conflict? Check out GitHub's [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) on how to resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
- We do have bots monitoring our open PRs, which will mark PRs as stale if they haven't had any activity within 30 days and close stale issues without activity after another 7 days. If you feel this was in error, please reach out to us or reopen the issue with more information.
