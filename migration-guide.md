# Migrating from the Unleash Proxy to Edge

Edge is built to be a near drop-in replacement for the Unleash proxy, but there are some differences. This guide takes you through
- the differences between Edge and the Unleash proxy
- how to migrate from the Unleash proxy to Edge
- in cases where the feature set isn't equivalent, how to achieve the same results in Edge.

A full [Docker compose file](./examples/docker-compose.yml) is also provided. It will spin up Edge, Unleash, and Redis, to allow you to understand the configuration options in context.

After starting the compose, you should be able to access the Unleash UI at `http://localhost:4242`, add a toggle, and cURL the edge instance with:

``` sh
curl --location --request GET 'http://0.0.0.0:3063/api/client/features' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: default:development.unleash-insecure-api-token' \
--data-raw ''
```

## Not supported

- [Custom Strategies](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/custom-activation-strategies) are not supported in Edge today. If you need to use a custom strategy, you will need to use the Unleash proxy. We believe that the overwhelming majority of custom strategies are better expressed as a set of [strategy constraints](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/strategy-constraints). If you have a situation where constraints **cannot** replace your strategy, please raise this as an issue with details on what you're trying to achieve. We are looking into supporting custom strategies in Edge in the future.

- Legacy proxy Tokens. If you're using the proxy, you may be using the legacy proxy token format. These are not supported in Edge. You will need to create a new front end SDK token in the Unleash UI and use that. These are the same tokens that the front end API requires. Because of the way Edge handles API tokens, this is not a feature we're planning to support.

- CORS configuration. Edge does not support CORS configuration, we accept any request. If you need this feature, please raise an issue or submit a PR.

- Context enrichers. The Unleash proxy provides an experimental option to automatically enrich requests with additional context. This is not supported in currently in Edge, we're open to adding this feature to Edge, opening an issue would help us to know that this is a valuable feature to you.

- JS integration. Edge is written in Rust. The Unleash proxy is written JavaScript. If you're wrapping the proxy code in your own JavaScript, you'll need to port that equivalent code to Rust. Generally, if you have a deep integration on the existing proxy, we would recommend either not moving to Edge, or to reach out to us to discuss your use case.


## Existing features in new ways

This section is to detail features that have changed in meaningful ways from the proxy implementation. These features all exist in Edge but you may find yourself thinking about them in new ways.

- New modes of operation. Edge supports two modes of operation - Edge mode and Offline mode. Offline mode is described in more detail later. If you're using the proxy today, you very likely want Edge mode. Edge mode will allow Unleash to sync its feature information from upstream Unleash instances and serve requests from that information in a similar way to the proxy. Unlike the proxy you need to specify the mode on startup. Example run command:

    ``` sh
    ./edge edge --upstream-url http://localhost:4242
    ```

- API Tokens. If you're using the proxy, you'll be familiar with the idea of specifying a token for the proxy to communicate with Unleash. This is not strictly necessary when using Edge; Edge is smart enough to reuse the tokens that are sent from your backend SDKs and intelligently and dynamically determine what tokens are necessary to provide a full set of details to all the SDKs that it's seen. This is all handled behind the scenes for you, so if you're only using backend SDKs, not specifying a token is fine. In practice, this means that the very first request to Edge that Edge doesn't currently have data for, will result in Edge blocking that request until it can resolve that data. If you want to hot start your cache and avoid this problem or you're using front end SDKs with Edge, you can specify a token in the Edge configuration. Note that if you're using a front end SDK then you'll either need to specify a backend SDK token at startup or ensure that at least one request has been made to Edge with a valid SDK token that is able to resolve all the environments and projects that you want to use front end SDKs with.


- Backups. By default the Unleash proxy will dump all of its feature information to disk to ensure that restarts have all the data you need to start serving requests as fast as possible. Edge does this by default but it also allows you the option to set other methods of storage rather than just flat files. Today we only support Redis (if you want support for a storage technology that we don't support, please feel free to raise ticket or open a PR!). To use Redis, you'll need to specify a valid connection to your storage provider in the Edge configuration. This means that Edge will lazily sync its data to the specified provider in the background and read that back on startup, if present. If you're using Redis, you'll need to ensure that the Redis instance is available before starting Edge. Example run command:

    ``` sh
    ./edge edge --upstream-url http://localhost:4242 --redis-url redis://localhost:6379

    ```

- Multiple environments. The Unleash proxy only supports a single environment, provided by your API key when starting up. Edge does not suffer from this limitation, any connecting SDK can freely use API tokens to scope its request to an environment, project or both, so long as the upstream Unleash instance has that token. This is dynamically determined by Edge, so adding a new token to the upstream Unleash and using that token in an SDK talking to Edge will work without restarting Edge or changing configuration.

- Scaling out Edge. Edge is built with high performance scaling as a first class citizen. Typically, the proxy would be scaled out by spinning up multiple instances, due to the limitations in JS engines that prevent using all available cores. The other reason for potentially scaling out the proxy is that the proxy doesn't support multiple environments. Edge doesn't have these requirements, multiple environments are supported out the box and Edge, by default, will use all the processing power that's available to it to scale up. Edge runs cold. Unless you're running Edge at extreme scaling levels, it's very likely that you won't need to scale out your Edge instance at all; in fact, its more likely that you want to _reduce_ the resources available to Edge.


## Existing features with new configuration options

This section unpacks the small changes in Edge from the proxy. These are ports of existing features or configuration that have small changes. These shouldn't affect how you use Edge and the ideas here are similar to the proxy, only small details have changed.

- Unleash URL. The proxy requires that you specify an Unleash URL to the upstream server, in the format https://{unleashUrl}/api. Edge has changed this, the URL that Edge requires is https://{unleashUrl}, without the `/api` suffix.

- Backend SDK support. The proxy does support connecting to backend SDKs, but it requires some configuration and setting some experimental feature flags. Edge supports this out the box, no additional configuration is required.


## New features

- Offline mode. Edge can be used in a purely offline mode. While the proxy does support this, it requires a little work to get there. Edge, on the other hand, supports this directly and out the box. This can be useful for testing or development environments where you don't want to have to run an Unleash instance or want to freeze your configuration in place. Example run command:

    ``` sh
    ./edge offline --tokens "*.development.some-test-token"  --bootstrap-file ./examples/features.json
    ```

    This will start Edge in offline mode and set the initial feature set to the contents of the `features.json` file. Edge will not send metrics to upstream Unleash instances, update its feature information, or dynamically resolve tokens. Note that you must set a token or tokens on startup in this mode - Edge will only use this set of tokens to validate incoming requests, this doesn't have to be a valid Unleash token, so this is very similar to the original proxy tokens.

- Daisy chaining. Edge is capable of both mimicking an Unleash server and talking to an Unleash server. This means that Edge can use another Edge instance as another upstream source. This can be extremely useful for high scaling scenarios where you can have a single instance close to your SDKs that retrieves all toggles for all projects and environments and specific Edge instances syncing to the parent Edge instance, with much more narrowly defined API tokens for security reasons. No extra configuration is needed to achieve this, simply point the downstream Edge instance at the upstream Edge instance and it will automatically resolve the tokens and features from the upstream Edge instance. Metrics will propagate up the daisy chain from downstream Edge instances to upstream instances until the metrics hit the end of the chain. There are two important details you need to be aware of when using daisy chaining with a top level instance in offline mode. Firstly, you won't receive any metrics for your connected SDKs - the metrics will propagate all the way to the final offline instance in the chain and then be discarded. Secondly, the top level instance needs to be started with all the API tokens necessary to serve downstream SDK requests.
